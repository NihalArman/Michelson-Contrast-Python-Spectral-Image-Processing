# Michelson-Contrast-Python-Spectral-Image-Processing
Specific area contrast has been plotted by using Michelson contrast formula for every bands of the image

Michelson contrast (also known as the visibility) is commonly used for patterns where both bright and dark features are equivalent and take up similar fractions of the area (e.g. sine-wave gratings). The Michelson contrast is defined as (Imax - Imin)/(Imax + Imin)
